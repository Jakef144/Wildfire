All 16 national teams had between one and\\rsix assignments each.

On September 8th one additional MAFFS from the\\r202nd Airlift wing was positioned at Fresno, CA. On September 16th all MAFFS were\\rreleased back to the DOD.\\r\\rMAFFS units primarily provided retardant delivery to the Northern and Southern California\\rGeographic Areas while employed from July 22 through September 16.  These units\\rdelivered a total of 820,115 gallons of retardant while conducting 293 sorties.  This is up\\rfrom 2016 when 165 sorties were flown delivering 395,632 gallons of retardant.\\r\\rOn August 14th one RC-26 aircraft and support personnel from the 141st Aerial Refueling\\rWing (Washington Air National Guard) was deployed to Fairchild AFB (Spokane, WA) in\\rsupport of wildland fire operations. A second RC-26 aircraft and support personnel from\\rthe 162nd Fighter Wing (Arizona Air National Guard) was deployed to Mahlon Sweet Field\\r(Eugene, OR) in support of wildland fire operations.

    "5": " \n 4\n2008 Fire Season Summary  \n \nWinter (December 2007 – February 2008) \n \nThe winter (December through February) of 2007-2008 was wetter than normal over much of \nthe central U.S. extending from southern California to the northeastern seaboard. The north-\ncentral plains and the area from west Texas across to the Appalachian Mountains was drier than \nnormal. Temperatures were generally colder than normal in the West and warmer than normal \nin the East. Alaska saw near normal temperatures with below normal snow packs in the eastern \nhalf of the state. Drought conditions persisted across portions of the West, Texas, and especially \nthe Appalachian Mountains as of mid-winter.  \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe initial seasonal outlook reports for the Southern and Eastern Areas called for above normal \nsignificant fire potential over central Texas, much of Florida, and from the Appalachian \nMountains along the eastern seaboard to southern Maine. Normal potential was forecast for the \nremainder of the area (see image).  \n \nThe Glass fire, which burned nearly 220,000 acres in Texas, was the largest fire in 2008. Fire \nactivity in Texas remained well above average through the winter period due to above normal \n",
    "6": " \n 5\nfine fuel loading and very dry, windy conditions. Significant fires were usually associated with \nfrontal passages with low relative humidity and wind speeds exceeding 25 mph. The Glass fire \noccurred under these conditions and burned 9 miles under a west wind before burning another \n40 miles to the south after the winds shifted out of the north. The southern Appalachian \nMountains also experienced numerous fires due to extreme drought and very dry deep organic \nsoils.  \n \nSpring (March – May) \n \nSpring was cooler than normal across most of the country except for warmer than average \nconditions over Texas and portions of southern California and the northeastern seaboard. \nOverall, California was far drier than anywhere else in the country and several locations in \nnorthern California experienced the driest spring (March – May) on record. Conversely, sections \nof central U.S. from the western Great Lakes south to Arkansas, then extending northeast into \nNew York was much wetter than normal. Alaska saw drier than normal conditions across the \neast-central interior. Much of the Southwest and portions of the Southeast also experienced a \ndry spring. Mountain snowpack amounts across the West were near average in most locations, \nbut well above average in the Cascades, portions of central Oregon and Washington, and \nnorthern Nevada. Percent of normal snow pack amounts as of May 1 across the West and in \nAlaska were dramatically higher than in 2007. \n \n       \n  \n \n \nThe Southern Area had an active spring fire season and by the end of May had experienced \n15,828 fires burning 1,070,536 acres (which is 150 percent of their normal year-to-date acres \nbased on a 10-year average). Rainfall deficits were primarily centered in central Texas and the \nsouthern Appalachian Mountains, especially in western North Carolina (see images). Fuels were \nexceptionally dry in these areas with Energy Release Component values exceeding the 97th \npercentile or historic maximums in many locations. Large fire activity began to taper off in south \nTexas after March. \n \n",
    "7": " \n 6\n \n \n \nWildfire activity in the Eastern Area was running below normal during the spring both in terms \nof overall fires and acres burned. By the end of May, the Eastern Area had burned only 44 \npercent of their average acres.  \n \nThe Southwest Area issued a fuels advisory in early May for very heavy fine fuel loadings \ncombined with very dry conditions across southern Arizona and eastern New Mexico (see \nimage). By the end of May, the Southwest had burned approximately 95 percent of their 10-\nyear average year-to-date acres. \n \n \nUp until the end of May, fire season 2008 could be described as below average nationally. \nThere were 27,042 fires reported for 1,500,637 acres burned nationally. This was just 59 \npercent of the 10-year average for fires, and 42 percent of acres burned to date. The Southern \nArea was the most active Geographic Area during the spring but experienced only 66 percent \nof its 10-year average for fires, but 150 percent of its 10-year average for acres burned. The \nSouthwest Area, which typically experiences an early onset to fire season, reported just 40 \npercent of its 10-year average for fires, and 95 percent of its 10-year average acres burned. \n \n \n",
    "8": " \n 7\n \n \nSummer (June – August) \n \nThe summer of 2008 started off very warm across the southern half of the nation and \nunseasonably cool across the northern tier of the country west of the Great Lakes. Temperatures \nwere near to slightly above normal across much of the West in July through the first half of \nAugust. It was also drier than normal throughout much of the summer across the northwest \nquarter of the country with greatest departures in California, eastern Washington and northwest \nMontana. Dry conditions were also present over the Southeast, Texas and Oklahoma. A robust \nsouthwest monsoon started in early July with the main focus of moisture over Arizona and New \nMexico and extending into the southern California mountains and the extreme southern Great \nBasin. Mid to late August rain brought some relief to the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. \n \n \n \n",
    "9": " \n 8\nWinter snow packs across the mountains of northern California rapidly diminished early in the \nperiod from sustained hot, dry weather. This caused higher elevation fuels to dry out much \nmore rapidly than normal with National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) Energy Release \nComponent (ERC) values reaching critical values by mid-June. The image shown at left \ndisplays a 2008 ERC index trace for the Northern Sierras overlaid on the average and one-\nStandard Deviation bars for each day since 1990. The image shows how fuels steadily dried \nout and fire danger indices climbed and then remained well above normal into late August.  \n \nThe exceptionally dry spring, early snowmelt and dry fuels in northern California, set the stage \nfor pronounced large fire activity during the first half of the summer. On June 20 through June \n21 widespread lightning started nearly one thousand fires in northern California. The magnitude \nof ignitions quickly outpaced initial attack capability of firefighting resources. Accessible fires with \nlow resistance to control were easily contained while fires in remote and difficult terrain burned \nunstaffed for several days. Persistent dry fuels across the area caused many of these fires to \nget well established in steep mountainous terrain in the Klamath, Six Rivers, and Shasta-Trinity \nNational Forests. The Fire Spread Probability map included on the previous page displays the \nnumber and extent of the situation by the end of July. \n \n  \n \n \nHigher elevation snow packs across the Northwest, Idaho, and western Montana remained in \nplace longer than normal due to a cool, wet spring. This helped to abate the risk of large fires \nacross much of the northwestern U.S. until mid summer.  \n \nCentral Texas remained dry and saw continued above average fire activity through the majority \nof the period. With the transition of spring to summer weather patterns were characterized by \nintense drying but less frequent and weaker wind events. The bulk of the fire activity shifted into \neast/central Texas with fires spreading in cured grass with brush and timber fuels adding to fire \nintensity and persistence.  \n \nWestern Great Basin was another area that saw a significant increase in fire danger during June \nand July. Although the area had abundant dry fuels, by the end of August the Western Great \nBasin had only burned 11 percent of their normal year-to-date acres.  \n \n",
    "10": " \n 9\nBy mid-August, fire activity picked up considerably across much of the west. Frequent lightning \nstorms tracked across much of the west, and while initial attack activity remained below normal \nin most areas, numerous large fires emerged, especially in the Northwest, Idaho and Montana.  \n \nFortunately, Alaska did not dry out sufficiently to become a major concern during the summer, \nburning only 4 percent of normal acres by the end of August. The Rocky Mountain Area also \nhad a below normal summer season in terms of large fire events. Several wet thunderstorm \nevents worked their way across Colorado and Wyoming, keeping fuels from drying out to critical \nlevels for any sustained periods of time.  By the end of August, a lower than average number of \nfire starts were recorded in the Rocky Mountain Area.   \n \nIn the East, Ohio and the southern Great Lakes area started the period out much wetter than \nnormal but then turned quite dry by the end of July into August. The southern Appalachian \nMountains saw continued dry weather with areas of exceptional drought, especially in the \nwestern portions of North and South Carolina, northern Georgia and Alabama, and eastern \nTennessee.   \n \nThe National Wildland Fire Potential Outlook, issued May 1, 2008, called for above normal \nsignificant fire potential across much of southern California, southern Arizona and New Mexico, \nwest Texas, Florida, and portions of the central U.S. for May. Significant fire potential was \nexpected to decrease across Florida, west Texas, and the southern half of the central plains \nduring the June through August time period.   \n \nNationally, by the end of August, 64,326 fires had occurred, burning 4,674,493 acres. This \nrepresents 105 percent of the number of fires, but only 89 percent of total acres burned in \ncomparison to the 10-year national average. In 2007, 1,298 more fires had occurred, and \n2,252,222 more acres had burned as of August 31. Overall, most Geographic Areas experienced \nbelow average numbers of fires, except for Northern and Southern California Geographic Areas \nand the Southern Geographic Area. Northern California reported 3,796 fires and 850,579 acres \nburned, which is 130 percent of its 10-year fire average, and 880 percent of its 10-year average \nfor acres burned. Southern California reported 3,788 fires and 365,500 acres burned as of \nAugust 31, or 124 percent of its 10-year fire average and 265 percent of its 10-year average for \nacres burned. The Southern Area reported 36,925 fires and 2,038,493 acres burned, or 129 \npercent of its 10-year average number of fires and 240 percent of the 10-year average number \nof acres burned. Texas remained active through much of the summer due to persistent and \nexceptionally dry fuels. \n \nGeographic Areas that experienced below average fire seasons (for both number of fires and \nnumber of acres burned) were Alaska, Northwest, Northern Rockies, the Great Basin (Eastern \nand Western), and Eastern Area. The Southwest Area experienced just 63 percent of its average \nnumber of fires, but burned 115 percent of acres. The Rocky Mountain Area experienced 77 \npercent of its average number of fires, yet burned 126 percent of average acres. \n \nFall (September – November)  \n \nSeptember had warmer than normal weather across the country, except cooler than normal in \nthe central states. It was quite dry in the West and Southeast with some portions of California \nreporting a record dry September. Much of the rest of the country experienced wet conditions, \nwith heavy rainfall in the Mississippi River Valley and Midwest due to moisture from hurricanes \n",
    "11": " \n 10\nGustav and Ike. By October, much of the nation was cooler than normal except for continued \nwarmth in the Southwest. The West had very dry weather, while the Plains, New England and \nportions of the Southeast were wetter than usual. November was warm in the West and cool in \nthe East. Rainfall was near to above normal across most of the country, except for dryness from \nTexas northward into the Midwest.  \n \n \nResource Mobilizations \n \nCanada provided two Type 1 crews for 17 days, and 16 fire managers and specialists to \nCalifornia. Australia and New Zealand provided 49 fire managers and specialists to California \nfor 37 days.  \n \nEight National Guard Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS) C-130 aircraft were \ndeployed to California (the first on June 23) to support fire suppression operations in that state. \nThese aircraft, three each from North Carolina and Wyoming, and two from Colorado flew 480 \nmissions and dropped 1,325,000 gallons of fire retardant. The last MAFFS were released on \nAugust 1. \n \nHurricane Activity \n \nThe 2008 Atlantic hurricane season experienced much above normal tropical activity.  As of \nNovember 10, 2008, 17 named storms had occurred, including eight hurricanes,   five of them \nmajor (Category 3 or higher). The hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with \nAugust and September typically being the most active months. Normal activity for the hurricane \nseason is 11 named storms with 6 becoming hurricanes, 2 of which being at least of Category 3 \nstrength. Early season tropical forecasts called for above normal tropical activity for the 2008 \nseason, with mid-season updates reinforcing the initial forecast. Seven Incident Management \nTeams were requested and/or pre-positioned in support of tropical storm activity.

    "12": " \n 11\n \n \nNational Fire Activity Synopsis \n \nThe 2008 fire season was near normal for both wildfires and acres burned. There were 78,949 \nwildfires reported to NICC in 2008 (compared to 85,705 wildfires were reported in 2007). This is \n98 percent of the 10-year average, and 97 percent of the 20-year average. The number of acres \nburned in 2008 was 5,292,468, considerably less than the 9,328,045 acres burned in 2007. The \nnumber of acres burned in 2008 was 81 percent of the 10-year average, and 108 percent of the \n20-year average. \n \nThree Geographic Areas reported an above average number of fires in 2008. Four Geographic \nAreas experienced above average acres burned in 2008. Seven Geographic Areas, Alaska, \nNorthwest, Northern Rockies, Eastern Great Basin, Western Great Basin, Rocky Mountain and \nEastern Area, had below average fire seasons (both wildfires and acres burned) in 2008. The \nSouthwest Area had only 67 percent of average for number of fires but burned 130 percent of \nthe 10-year average number of acres. \n \nTwenty-four fires or complexes exceeded 40,000 acres in size in 2008, compared to 53 in 2007 \n(page 13). These fires occurred in seven Geographic Areas (Northern Rockies, Northern and \nSouthern California, Southern Area, Western Great Basin, Rocky Mountain and Southwest \nAreas). Northern California had the highest number at ten, followed by the Southern Area with \nsix. Half of the 24 largest fires or complexes occurred in California. \n \nA total of 7,669 prescribed fire projects were reported in 2008, down significantly from the \nprevious year’s 24,073 projects (page 25). The number of projects was significantly lower than \nthe 10-year annual average of 13,857 projects. The 1,935,001 acres accomplished in 2008 were \nalso down from the 10-year average of 2,187,642. The 2008 figure is also more than a million \nfewer accomplished acres than in 2007. \n \nA total of 265 Wildland Fire Use incidents occurred in 2008, below the 10-year annual average \nof 327 incidents (page 29). However, the number of acres burned was well above the 10-year \naverage at 236,835. The 10-year annual average is 187,416 acres.  \n",
    "13": " \n 12\n \nThe nation was at Preparedness Levels 4 and 5 for 58 days in 2008, the fourth highest number \nof days since 1990 (page 32). The 10-year average is 46 days at PL 4 and 5 combined. \n \nThe demand for national Incident Management Teams was lower in 2008 than in recent years. \nType 1 Teams were mobilized 41 times and spent 609 days on assignments. This is down \nconsiderably from last year when Type 1 teams were mobilized 62 times and spent 805 days on \nassignments. The 10-year average is 57 assignments annually. \n \nType 2 Teams were mobilized 125 times and spent 1,232 days on assignments in 2008. In 2007, \nType 2 Teams were mobilized 159 times, and spent 1,590 days on assignments. Fire Use \nManagement Teams were mobilized 18 times and spent 230 days on assignments in 2008. In \n2007, Fire Use Management Teams were mobilized 19 times, spending 295 days on \nassignments. \n \nFour Area Command Teams were mobilized seven times and spent 122 days on assignments \nin 2008. In 2007, five Area Command Teams were mobilized 11 times and spent 154 days on \nassignments. Two National Incident Management Organizations were mobilized 17 times and \nspent 246 days on assignments in 2008.
